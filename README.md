I've worked in an array of hardware and software focused roles -- troubleshooting,
system resets, project management, research, and more -- in big teams and small.
Presently, my interests stay in information security, network, and software engineering.
I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with my bachelor's in 2024.

Big fan of C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby. I've also worked with HTML/CSS, Dart,
MySQL, and a few variants of x86 Assembly. Learning Rust.

Don't ask me about Haskell.
