I've worked in an array of hardware and software focused roles - troubleshooting,
system resets, project management, research, and more - in big teams and small.
Presently, my interests stay in information security, network, and software engineering.
I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with my bachelor's in 2024.

Big fan of C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby. I've also worked with Haskell, Dart,
MySQL, and Assembly Language. Learning Rust.

I put some other nice things on my resume, but those repos may be private. Message
me to request access!
